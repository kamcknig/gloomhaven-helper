add a way to quickly remove a token rather than making it's HP 0. You can do that a little quicker than using
the arrows by going into the token details dialog and setting it to 0 but should there be an even quicker way?
A delete button on that dialog? One on the monster list and/or detail view? on the token selection dialog?

extract header element icons into components

the delete button on detail cards is hard to see when the change
view mode is over it

add attribute modification data to monster card json. add net attributes display to show monsters
actual attributes with their currently drawn card
