extract header element icons into components

add attribute modification data to monster card json. add net attributes display to show monsters
actual attributes with their currently drawn card

on death effect for monster abilities like cultist # 7 card

optional monster attack card options such as earth demon 5

Mouse over for tokens in list view to show status

scroll monster detail into view for whoever turn it is when in detail vie wmode

add way to add arbitrary tokens like the guys in tribal assault scenario 44

when drawing a card manually, i don't think it's sorting

the monster-ability-deck-component and monster-detail-component both create an observable to get the activeCard$.
This should be combined into one place.

bosses dont' have a way to lower hit points

forest imp is missing shield icon, are others?

add infuse actions

add icons inside of text actions like with forest imp (there are others, you'll have to look at
all the card images to find them)
